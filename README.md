## About me
Hello there! I'm Xopre, a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Seville.

I have been working on different projects in the last few years, so feel free to check what I've done in my repositories :). Last year I finished my [master's thesis](https://xopre.github.io/RAPS/) as part of the [master in artificial intelligence](http://www.cs.us.es/blogs/mulcia/) at the Universidad de Sevilla. At that time I was working in the [TAL.IA project](https://github.com/TAL-IA), focused on Sign Languages and AI, using data augmentation and deepfakes in order to attack the data scarcity problem.
